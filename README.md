# Flight Simulation for 3rd Person: Number 01

[Code inspired by this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/)

## Topic

The scene is of an x-wing fighter flying over a desert landscape in space and making a u-turn around a rotating satellite.  Two spotlights rotate and illuminate the entire scene.  

This scene repeats indefinitely.  So there is plenty of time to explore it by moving the camera using the following keys:

* W or Z: move camera forward (into screen)
* S move camera backwards (out of screen)
* A or Q: move camera left
* D: move camera right

* KEY_UP: angle camera up
* KEY_DOWN: angle camera down
* KEY_LEFT: angle camera left
* KEY_RIGHT: angle camera right
