# Flight Simulation for 3rd Person: Number 02

[Code inspired by this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/)

## Topic

The scene is an improvement on the #1 scene in a few specific ways:

* the x-wing fighter flies along a closed curve and the turns are smooth
* the ground has been replaced by a spherical moon
* the spotlights now reside inside the rotating satellite
* 2 pointlights have been distributed to the x-wing fighter and the third one to the satellite

This scene repeats indefinitely.  So there is plenty of time to explore it by moving the camera using the following keys:

* W or Z: move camera forward (into screen)
* S move camera backwards (out of screen)
* A or Q: move camera left
* D: move camera right

* KEY_UP: angle camera up
* KEY_DOWN: angle camera down
* KEY_LEFT: angle camera left
* KEY_RIGHT: angle camera right
